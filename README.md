 Installation

 Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- Truffle (`npm install -g truffle`)
- Ganache or a compatible Ethereum testnet (e.g., Rinkeby)
- MetaMask wallet extension installed in your browser
- Git

 Steps

1. Clone the Repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/web3devworld/ai-generated-art-marketplace.git
   cd ai-generated-art-marketplace
   ```

2. Install Dependencies
   - Backend:
     ```bash
     cd backend
     npm install
     ```
   - Frontend:
     ```bash
     cd ../frontend
     npm install
     ```

3. Set Up Environment Variables
   - Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory with the following variables:
     ```
     PORT=5000
     INFURA_PROJECT_ID=your-infura-project-id
     INFURA_SECRET_KEY=your-infura-secret-key
     ```
   - Create a `.env` file in the `frontend` directory with the following variable:
     ```
     REACT_APP_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=your-contract-address
     ```

4. Compile and Deploy the Smart Contract
   - Ensure you have a compatible Ethereum network running (e.g., Ganache or Rinkeby).
   - Compile and deploy the smart contract using Truffle:
     ```bash
     truffle compile
     truffle migrate --network rinkeby
     ```
   - Note the deployed contract address and update it in the `frontend/.env` file.



 Deployment

 Backend Server
1. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   node server.js
   ```
   The server will run on `http://localhost:5000`.

 Frontend Application
1. Start the React frontend:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm start
   ```
   The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

 Smart Contract Deployment
1. Ensure your wallet is connected to the desired Ethereum network (e.g., Rinkeby).
2. Use the Truffle migration script to deploy the contract:
   ```bash
   truffle migrate --network rinkeby
   ```
3. Update the frontend `.env` file with the deployed contract address.
